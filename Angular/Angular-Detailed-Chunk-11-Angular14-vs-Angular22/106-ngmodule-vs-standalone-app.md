# How Does an Angular 14 NgModule Application Differ from an Angular 22 Standalone Application?

> Senior Angular and .NET interview guide. Version baseline: Angular 14 versus Angular 22.

## 1. What problem does it solve?

Create understandable application composition, lazy-loading, and provider scopes without large transitive module graphs.

This matters in a senior interview because the interviewer is not looking only for syntax. They want to know whether you understand ownership, lifecycle, performance, compatibility, security, and rollout risk across an Angular frontend and an ASP.NET Core backend.

---

## 2. Explain it in simple language

An Angular 14 application normally starts through AppModule, declares components in modules, and imports modules for template dependencies. A modern standalone application starts a root component directly, imports dependencies at components/routes, and configures providers with application or route provider functions.

### Memory anchor

> **Angular 14 shows where the framework came from; Angular 22 makes dependency, state, and rendering notifications more explicit.**

### Interview-ready answer

> An Angular 14 application normally starts through AppModule, declares components in modules, and imports modules for template dependencies. A modern standalone application starts a root component directly, imports dependencies at components/routes, and configures providers with application or route provider functions. I would adopt the modern API at a feature boundary, keep backend contracts authoritative, test observable behavior, and measure whether the change improves build time, runtime performance, maintainability, or reliability.

## 3. How does it work internally?

NgModules create compilation scopes from declarations, imports, and exports; their providers participate in injector hierarchies. Standalone metadata gives the compiler each component scope directly. bootstrapApplication creates the root environment injector, while route providers create child environment injectors. Provider lifetime remains a design concern in both models.

### Practical code shape

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes), provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor]))]
});

export const routes: Routes = [{
  path: 'disputes',
  loadComponent: () => import('./disputes/page').then(m => m.DisputesPage),
  providers: [DisputeStore]
}];
```

### Internal mental model

1. The Angular compiler turns templates and metadata into executable view instructions.
2. Dependency injection resolves services from the closest matching environment or element injector.
3. State changes notify Angular through supported mechanisms; modern signals make those dependencies explicit.
4. The renderer reconciles only the views and DOM identities that need work.
5. HTTP, authorization, validation, concurrency, and durable consistency still cross a trust boundary into ASP.NET Core.

Do not describe a modern Angular feature as magic. Explain what creates the value, who owns it, what causes an update, and when its lifetime ends.

## 4. Realistic payment or banking example

The Disputes route lazy-loads a standalone page and provides DisputeStore at route scope, so leaving the feature clears sensitive draft state.

### Responsibility boundary

| Angular responsibility | ASP.NET Core responsibility |
|---|---|
| Present typed state and accessible feedback | Authenticate and authorize every request |
| Prevent accidental duplicate gestures | Guarantee idempotent money movement |
| Validate for fast user feedback | Repeat authoritative domain validation |
| Cancel or ignore stale reads | Honor cancellation where safe and protect consistency |
| Map transport DTOs to stable view models | Version contracts and return safe ProblemDetails |

The browser is an untrusted client. A route guard, disabled button, hidden menu, or client validator improves user experience but never replaces API authorization or domain rules.

---

## 5. Successful flow and failure flow

### Successful flow

Feature bundle loads on navigation; feature providers exist once for that route tree; dependencies are visible near ownership.

1. The UI receives or derives a typed state.
2. Angular updates the smallest relevant view region.
3. A semantic user intent is mapped to a request DTO.
4. ASP.NET Core authenticates, authorizes, validates, and applies concurrency/idempotency controls.
5. The response is mapped to a view model and telemetry records the outcome.

### Failure flow

A root-provided feature store retains one customer draft after logout, or the same service is provided at multiple component levels and state unexpectedly splits.

1. Client shows a safe validation, authorization, offline, timeout, or conflict state.
2. Technical details are logged with correlation IDs, not exposed to the customer.
3. Retriable reads may retry with a bound policy; commands retry only with a sound idempotency design.
4. Unknown states fail safely and remain observable.

---

## 6. Practical Angular and C#/.NET example

### Angular

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes), provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor]))]
});

export const routes: Routes = [{
  path: 'disputes',
  loadComponent: () => import('./disputes/page').then(m => m.DisputesPage),
  providers: [DisputeStore]
}];
```

### ASP.NET Core remains authoritative

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "Payments.Write")]
[HttpPost("{paymentId:guid}/approve")]
public async Task<ActionResult<PaymentDto>> Approve(
    Guid paymentId,
    ApprovePaymentRequest request,
    [FromHeader(Name = "Idempotency-Key")] string idempotencyKey,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var command = mapper.ToCommand(paymentId, request, User, idempotencyKey);
    var result = await workflow.ApproveAsync(command, cancellationToken);
    return result.Match<ActionResult<PaymentDto>>(
        ok => Ok(mapper.ToDto(ok)),
        invalid => ValidationProblem(invalid.ToModelState()),
        forbidden => Forbid(),
        conflict => Conflict(conflict.ToProblemDetails()));
}
```

### Why show .NET in an Angular answer?

A senior full-stack answer identifies the trust boundary. Angular owns interaction and presentation. The API owns financial authority. Compile-time TypeScript safety cannot validate runtime JSON, authorize an account, prevent forged requests, or guarantee exactly one financial effect.

### Tests worth mentioning

- Angular unit/component test for state, rendering, and emitted intent.
- Contract test for DTO compatibility and unknown enum values.
- API authorization tests for anonymous, forbidden, and allowed users.
- Idempotency and optimistic-concurrency tests for commands.
- Browser test for focus, keyboard, accessibility, refresh, and slow-network behavior.

---

## 7. Important design decisions

Organize by business feature, not by framework artifact; keep public imports small; use route scope for feature lifetime; interoperate during migration.

Also decide:

- Who owns the source of truth?
- What is the provider/state lifetime: application, route, component, or request?
- What is the stable public component and API contract?
- What compatibility bridge is temporary, and how will it be removed?
- Which metric proves the modernization created value?
- What is the rollback boundary if production regresses?

---

## 8. When to use and when not to use it

### Use the modern approach when

- Starting a new Angular 22 feature or a well-isolated modernization boundary.
- It simplifies dependency visibility, synchronous state, rendering, testing, or delivery.
- The team can verify behavior and support the chosen API in production.

### Do not force it when

- A stable legacy feature would be rewritten only to look modern, without measurable value.
- A third-party library or custom build integration is not compatible.
- RxJS better models the asynchronous sequence or concurrency policy.
- The migration combines too many independent risks in one release.
- Client code is being proposed as a replacement for backend security or consistency.

---

## 9. Compare it with related concepts

| Concept | Best mental model |
|---|---|
| AppModule | Root NgModule bootstrap and transitive imports |
| bootstrapApplication | Direct root bootstrap with providers |
| Module lazy loading | loadChildren module boundary |
| Standalone lazy loading | loadComponent or route-file loadChildren |

### Lead-level comparison rule

Do not say one option is universally better. Compare source of truth, notification model, lifetime, cancellation, error handling, compiler support, testability, ecosystem maturity, and migration cost.

---

## 10. Common production mistakes

- Upgrading framework, build system, state architecture, forms, and tests in one unreviewable change.
- Copying state between inputs, signals, subjects, and stores until no source of truth is clear.
- Providing the same service at several injector levels accidentally.
- Assuming TypeScript types validate JSON received at runtime.
- Using an effect to propagate state that should be computed or modeled as a stream.
- Measuring a development build instead of a production build with realistic data.
- Treating hidden UI or a route guard as authorization.
- Ignoring loading, empty, error, cancellation, retry, offline, and unknown-state behavior.
- Forgetting accessibility, focus preservation, and reduced-motion behavior during rendering changes.
- Removing compatibility code before third-party dependencies and rollback paths are verified.

> **Modern syntax is useful; a safe, observable, reversible design is senior engineering.**

## 11. Scenario-based interview question

You own a business-critical Angular 14 payment feature with good production stability but slow builds and difficult local state. The organization has reached Angular 22. Which part would you modernize first, what would you deliberately leave unchanged, and what objective evidence would let you continue or roll back?

### What a strong answer should cover

- Separate mandatory version compatibility from optional modernization.
- Name the source of truth and the browser/API trust boundary.
- Choose a small feature or route boundary with regression tests.
- Define build, bundle, runtime, error, accessibility, and business metrics.
- Explain canary/feature-flag rollout and rollback.
- Protect API contracts, authorization, idempotency, and audit history.

A modern standalone application starts a root component directly, imports dependencies at components/routes, and configures providers with application or route provider functions.
- **Banking rule:** Client feedback is helpful; backend enforcement is mandatory.
- **Migration rule:** Upgrade safely first, modernize intentionally second.
- **Interview rule:** Explain mechanism, trade-off, failure mode, measurement, and rollback.
